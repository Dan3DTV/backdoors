### Whats a backdoor?
Roblox backdoors are malicious scripts that load up modules into your game, which usually end up giving a group of "hackers" server-sided access to your game. Don't worry if you don't know what any of that means - we will go over it.
### Where backdoors come from?
Backdoors can come from anywhere. They mostly, though, come from free models and plugins. A skid will usually infect it with a malicious script, then bot it to the front page so more vulnerable people see it and insert it into their game.
They also come from plugins. When you install a shady plugin and go into a game, the plugin will insert a script into your game that loads up their backdoor. They can also make it impossible to delete.
They also come from .exe / .dmg files. You may ask how - well, the file may get into your place's XML and insert the malicious script from there. It is uncommon, but I have seen it happen.

Those places are the most common to see backdoors in. Make sure to use products only from trusted developers.
